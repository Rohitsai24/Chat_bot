1. Python installed on your machine.
2. A Google API key with access to the Gemini Pro model.
3. Streamlit library installed.
4. Google Generative AI library installed.
5. Python Dotenv library installed for managing environment variables.

### Setup

- Install the necessary libraries using pip.
- Create a `.env` file and add your Google API key to it.
- Create a Python file (e.g., `app.py`) to write your code.
- In the Python file, import the required libraries, configure the Gemini Pro model, and set up the Streamlit app interface.

### Running the Application

- Run the Streamlit application using the appropriate command.
- Open the provided local URL in your browser to access the chat application.
- Users can input their questions and interact with the Gemini Pro model to receive responses.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll have a functional Q&A chat application powered by Streamlit and the Google Gemini Pro model. Customize and enhance the application as needed for a seamless user experience.
